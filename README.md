# 🐾 Endangered Species in U.S. National Parks

This project analyzes data from the U.S. National Park Service to uncover patterns in conservation status, species type, and observation trends across four major parks. Using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries, we explore which species are protected, how often they're observed, and where conservation efforts might need more attention.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Investigate patterns in species conservation status across national parks and explore the visibility of endangered wildlife.
- **Datasets:**
  - `species_info.csv` – Species names, categories, and conservation status
  - `observations.csv` – Observation counts of species by park

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

1. Which parks report the most observations of protected species?
2. Do parks specialize in observing certain species categories?
3. Are protected species observed less often than non-protected ones?
4. Which species have the highest observation counts?
5. Which categories of species are most endangered?

## 📈 Key Findings

- 🏞 **Yellowstone National Park** had the most observations of protected species.
- 🌿 **Vascular plants** dominate observation counts in every park.
- 🐻 **Mammals** are the most commonly observed endangered species.
- 🧍‍♂️ **Protected species account for <3%** of all observations, reflecting their scarcity and the importance of conservation efforts.
